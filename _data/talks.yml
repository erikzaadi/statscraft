  speaker: Itai Frenkel
  summary: "Forter has been using Riemann for more than a year in production to monitor our highly complex, distributed system. We are using Riemann as our hub for alerts (PagerDuty), latency and exception reporting (Kibana) and system probes (Jenkins). This presentation will cover Riemann patterns for maintenance-mode, state machine based alerts, statistical alerts, system and integration tests based alerts, event enrichment and aggregation for reporting."

  speaker: Shahar Kedar
  summary: "Monitoring should not be about tools but rather about choice. For two decades, the choice of what should be measured and monitored was dictated by the tools avaialble. Now however, with the exlposion of Open-Source and SaaS, the question should no longer be 'What can I monitor?', but rather 'What should I monitor?' - a much harder but more important question to answer."
