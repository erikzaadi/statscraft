    Monitoring is hard.<br />
    Monitoring is non-functional, but at the same time, resource hungry.<br />
    Monitoring requires the right people.<br />
    #monitoringsucks because we're doing it wrong.<br />
    We'll review the problem, which, as always, originates with people, not tools.

    So we have deployed an application. It is running. How do we verify it keeps on running? 
    How do we get notified fast about any issues with the application? How do we garantee the service level we want to provide our customers? <br />
    The magic answer is to monitor our application. But wait, what does it mean to monitor? 
    What metrics should we monitor? What is the effective way to monitor those metrics? what about alerts?<br />
    In this talk we will explore a simple browser - server - database application with regard to monitoring. 
    What role have end user experience monitors, server side performance, operation, error and system monitors, database monitors as well as alerts.

    Forter has been using Riemann for more than a year in production to monitor our highly complex, distributed system.
    We are using Riemann as our hub for alerts (PagerDuty), latency and exception reporting (Kibana) and system probes (Jenkins).
    This presentation will cover Riemann patterns for maintenance-mode, state machine based alerts, statistical alerts,
    system and integration tests based alerts, event enrichment and aggregation for reporting.

  summary: >
    Monitoring should not be about tools but rather about choice. For two decades,
    the choice of what should be measured and monitored was dictated by the tools avaialble.
    Now however, with the exlposion of Open-Source and SaaS, the question should no longer be "What can I monitor?",
    but rather "What should I monitor?" - a much harder but more important question to answer.

    "With great power comes great confusion".<br />
    It is not enough to generate, collect and store metrics; One needs to know how to look and analyse them to get the full benefit of metrics.
    In this workshop we will learn how to use metrics to detect problems, correlate and investigate issues.
    This is a hands-on workshop. Although the workshop will use Graphite the methods are not Graphite specific.

- name: Monitoring with ELK
  type: workshop
  start: "14:00"
  end:   "16:00"
  speaker: "Tomer Levy and Asaf Yigal"
  summary: >
    ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana) is the leading open-source, log-analytics platform that is used by companies including Netflix,
    Verizon, and Bloomberg to prevent and troubleshoot problematic events in their systems. We will first discuss the various use-cases of using ELK.
    From Ops monitoring, APM, forensics to security monitoring and business intelligence.<br />
    <br />
    In the hands-on part we will train attendees on how to get started with ELK by shipping, parsing, and analyzing
    log data and then visualizing the events to understand them. As part of the hands-on session, we will learn how
    to leverage ELK to monitor system and application performance using dockerized, collectd/collectl containers.<br />
    <br />
    To get the best learning experience, attendees should bring their own laptop, have access to a machine that
    generates logs and be ready to run the hands-on exercises with us.

  summary: >
    While you can learn a lot by emitting metrics from your application, some insights can only be gained by looking at OS metrics.
    In this hands-on workshop, we will cover the basics in  Linux metric collection for monitoring, performance tuning and capacity planning.
    How to choose effective metrics? What is the best way to collect them? and more...

    "Developers, developers, developers.. " - The inventor of "Ballmer Peak"<br />
    Gather around as we get our hands dirty with code and tools to help you with monitoring your application and JVM level metrics.
    This workshop is all about coming to the office the next morning and putting this new found knowledge to use.
    You will be provided with a base image of Ubuntu with pre-installed Java application to which you will add monitoring and use different tools to investigate and understand whats going on inside.<br />

    Some of the tools we will use:<br />
     - JMX<br />
     - jvisualvm<br />
     - async/sync code timing<br />
     - MDC<br />
     - Coda Hale's "metrics"<br />
     - ELK <br />
     - Grafana
