      Forter has been using Riemann for more than a year in production to monitor our highly complex, distributed system.
      We are using Riemann as our hub for alerts (PagerDuty), latency and exception reporting (Kibana) and system probes (Jenkins).
      This presentation will cover Riemann patterns for maintenance-mode, state machine based alerts, statistical alerts,
      system and integration tests based alerts, event enrichment and aggregation for reporting.

      Monitoring should not be about tools but rather about choice. For two decades,
      the choice of what should be measured and monitored was dictated by the tools avaialble.
      Now however, with the exlposion of Open-Source and SaaS, the question should no longer be "What can I monitor?",
      but rather "What should I monitor?" - a much harder but more important question to answer.

      "With great power comes great confusion".<br />
      It is not enough to generate, collect and store metrics; One needs to know how to look and analyse them to get the full benefit of metrics.
      In this workshop we will learn how to use metrics to detect problems, correlate and investigate issues.
      This is a hands-on workshop. Although the workshop will use Graphite the methods are not Graphite specific.

      ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana) is the leading open-source, log-analytics platform that is used by companies including Netflix,
      Verizon, and Bloomberg to prevent and troubleshoot problematic events in their systems. We will first discuss the various use-cases of using ELK.
      From Ops monitoring, APM, forensics to security monitoring and business intelligence.<br />
      <br />
      In the hands-on part we will train attendees on how to get started with ELK by shipping, parsing, and analyzing
      log data and then visualizing the events to understand them. As part of the hands-on session, we will learn how
      to leverage ELK to monitor system and application performance using dockerized, collectd/collectl containers.<br />
      <br />
      To get the best learning experience, attendees should bring their own laptop, have access to a machine that
      generates logs and be ready to run the hands-on exercises with us.
