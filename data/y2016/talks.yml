        In this talk we will emphasize the need to take holistic approach to monitoring and using monitoring as a competitive advantage (I’m calling it, “the 4 layer monitoring model”).<br/>
        We will discuss the maturity of monitoring from the simple infrastructure layer we all know through service based monitoring, to insight/event driven data monitoring and finally monitoring our entire business.<br/>
        As an analytics solution we wanted to treat our data as we treat our customers business.

    summary: >
        In this talk two speakers from Forter will explain how we approach monitoring of “incoming” data after it was written to disk (at rest). The first problem we solve is business KPI based alerts. These require per-customer thresholds that also have time-seasonality. We will describe our dynamic thresholding algorithm to detect analytical and engineering anomalies that affect the business. More importantly this project is part of the BI team which is not officially part of R&D. The second problem we solve is data quality and consistency across different data stores. Our naive approach of “asserting” data was written to database after each system test/probe outlived its usefulness. We will describe why, and how the data reconciliator solves this problem differently. Related topics such as schema validation, data-remediation, pii redaction and data migration errors will also be discussed.

        "Once you start working with distributed Big Data systems, you start discovering a whole bunch of problems you won’t find in monolithic systems.All of a sudden to monitor all of the components becomes a big data problem itself.<br/>
        In the talk we'll mention all of the aspects that you should take in consideration when monitoring a distributed system once you're using tools like:
        Web Services, Apache Spark, Cassandra, MongoDB, Amazon Web Services.<br/>
        Not only the tools, what should you monitor about the actual data that flows in the system?<br/>
        And we’ll cover the simplest solution with your day to day open source tools, the surprising thing, that it comes not from an Ops Guy."

    summary: >
        When talking about monitoring usually what comes to mind is technical metrics like CPU, disk space, memory, time to server a request, etc. Those are nice, but those KPIs (usually) don't drive your business. It's how many interactions a user had, how much money we generated and how many new users joined is what driving the business. And as a business, those are the KPIs we should monitor and care about.<br/>Previously you had to beg for time from your developers to provision business metrics collection. In this talk I would like to show you how to do this without any developers involved by just using SQL and a tool like Redash.

        Monitoring, like with non-functional requirements, has traditionally been looked at from a dev/ops/devops perspective. But monitoring is not about tech, it's about business. We will show an alternative for how a domain-centred dialog can lead to better monitoring, echoing good old DDD concepts and aiming toward the breaking of more silos.

        Event Tracing for Windows is Microsoft’s structured logging infrastructure.<br/>Although it supports emitting your own custom messages, the cool thing about it is that Windows and many other Microsoft frameworks come built-in with thousands, if not tens of thousands of trace-points which allow you to monitor basically anything, on demand, both during development and on production.<br/>This includes standard metrics such as memory and CPU, but also more exotic things such as WCF functions, .NET exceptions, thread call-stacks, and even the Windows boot process!<br/>
        In this session we will see how to use freely available tools to monitor your applications and environments.

    summary: >
        Imagine you're tackling one of these evasive performance issues in the field, and your go-to monitoring checklist doesn't seem to cut it. There are plenty of suspects, but they are moving around rapidly and you need more logs, more data, more in-depth information to make a diagnosis. Maybe you've heard about DTrace, or even used it, and are yearning for a similar toolkit, which can plug dynamic tracing into a system that wasn't prepared or instrumented in any way.<br/>
        Hopefully, you won't have to yearn for a lot longer. eBPF (extended Berkeley Packet Filters) is a kernel technology that enables a plethora of diagnostic scenarios by introducing dynamic, safe, low-overhead, efficient programs that run in the context of your live kernel. Sure, BPF programs can attach to sockets; but more interestingly, they can attach to kprobes and uprobes, static kernel tracepoints, and even user-mode static probes. And modern BPF programs have access to a wide set of instructions and data structures, which means you can collect valuable information and analyze it on-the-fly, without spilling it to huge files and reading them from user space.<br/>
        In this talk, we will introduce BCC, the BPF Compiler Collection, which is an open set of tools and libraries for dynamic tracing on Linux. Some tools are easy and ready to use, such as execsnoop, fileslower, and memleak. Other tools such as trace and argdist require more sophistication and can be used as a Swiss Army knife for a variety of scenarios. We will spend most of the time demonstrating the power of modern dynamic tracing -- from memory leaks to static probes in Ruby, Node, and Java programs, from slow file I/O to monitoring network traffic. Finally, we will discuss building our own tools using the Python and Lua bindings to BCC, and its LLVM backend.
