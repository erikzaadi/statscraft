    summary: >
        "Oftentimes, the biggest issues in our applications are caused 
        by the people that use them. The real human users of our services can 
        cause us big headaches. A robust synthetics monitoring suite can step 
        into the place of a human user and save us before the real humans ever 
        show up and mess up our perfectly working applications! Come and learn 
        how to effectively use synthetics to detect issues before anyone else does. 
        Once you embrace synthetics monitoring, you'll never want to go back!"
